### 1. *Singly Linked List*
   - *Introduction:*
     - What is a linked list?
     - Differences from arrays.
     - Importance and where they are used.
   - *Structure of a Node:*
     - struct Node definition in C.
     - Explanation of pointers and how they link nodes together.
   - *Operations on Singly Linked List:*
     - *Insertion:*
       - At the beginning.
       - At the end.
       - At a specific position.
     - *Deletion:*
       - Deleting the first node.
       - Deleting the last node.
       - Deleting a node at a specific position.
     - *Traversal:*
       - Moving through the nodes using pointers.
       - Printing values in the list.
     - *Search Operation:*
       - Searching for an element in the linked list.
   - *Advantages of Singly Linked Lists:*
     - Dynamic size.
     - Ease of insertion and deletion.
   - *Disadvantages:*
     - No efficient backward traversal.
     - Extra memory for pointers.
   - *Applications of Singly Linked List:*
     - Implementation of stacks and queues.
     - Dynamic memory allocation.
     - Managing free memory (Garbage collection in memory management systems).

### 2. *Doubly Linked List*
   - *Introduction:*
     - Definition and differences from singly linked lists.
   - *Structure of a Node:*
     - struct Node definition in C (two pointers: next and prev).
   - *Operations on Doubly Linked List:*
     - *Insertion:*
       - At the beginning.
       - At the end.
       - At a specific position.
     - *Deletion:*
       - Deleting the first node.
       - Deleting the last node.
       - Deleting a node at a specific position.
     - *Traversal:*
       - Forward traversal using next.
       - Backward traversal using prev.
     - *Search Operation:*
       - Searching for an element in the doubly linked list.
   - *Advantages of Doubly Linked Lists:*
     - Efficient backward and forward traversal.
     - Flexibility in insertion and deletion operations.
   - *Disadvantages:*
     - Extra memory for prev pointer.
     - More complex implementation than singly linked lists.
   - *Applications of Doubly Linked List:*
     - Undo/redo functionality in software (e.g., text editors).
     - Browser navigation (back and forward functionality).
     - Managing resources in operating systems.

### 3. *Comparison: Singly vs Doubly Linked List*
   - Memory usage.
   - Efficiency in traversal.
   - Use cases where one is preferred over the other.

### 4. *Real-Time Example: Browser Navigation System*
   - *Scenario Explanation:*
     - How web browsers use doubly linked lists to manage "back" and "forward" navigation.
   - *Implementation in C:*
     - Define a structure representing browser history as a doubly linked list.
     - Demonstrate adding new URLs to history (insertion).
     - Moving back and forward (traversal using next and prev).
     - Deleting a specific URL or managing memory.
   - *Code Snippets:*
     - Sample code to show how this could be implemented in C.

### 5. *Conclusion*
   - When to use singly vs doubly linked lists.
   - Real-world significance in various software systems.
